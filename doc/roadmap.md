# Dokuti Roadmap

The Dokuti roadmap communicates project priorities for evolving and extending the scope of the product. New product experiences and features will include changes in various layers of the product.

The Dokuti team is currently focused on creating a secure document warehouse for enterprise use. We encourage the community to work with us to improve dokuti for these scenarios and extend it for others.

## Released Versions

## Upcoming Ship Dates

| Milestone                 | Release Date |
|---------------------------|--------------|
| dokuti 0.x | Approximately every 1-2 months or as needed |

Note: Dates are calendar year (as opposed to fiscal year).

Milestone information is available on most repos, for example [milestones](https://github.com/Grindrodbank/dokuti/milestones).

## Feedback

The best way to give feedback is to create issues in the [dokuti](https://github.com/Grindrodbank/dokuti) repo. You can also create issues in other [dokuti repos](Documentation/core-repos.md) if you find that to be more appropriate for the topic you want to discuss.

Although mostly obvious, please give us feedback that will give us insight on the following points:

* Existing features are missing some capability or otherwise don't work well enough.
* Missing features that should be added to the product.
* Design choices for a feature that is currently in-progress.

Some important caveats / notes:

* It is best to give design feedback quickly for improvements that are in-development. We're unlikely to hold a feature being part of a release on late feedback.
* We are most likely to include improvements that either have a positive impact on a broad scenario or have very significant positive impact on a niche scenario. This means that we are unlikely to prioritize modest improvements to niche scenarios.
* Compatibility will almost always be given a higher priority than improvements.
